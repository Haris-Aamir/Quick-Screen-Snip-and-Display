**Quick Screen Snip and Display** is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help teachers, presenters, and professionals who need to quickly capture and project specific portions of their screen. This program allows users to:

- Capture a selected region of their screen.
- Display the captured image on a black or white background.
- Drag the displayed image to reposition it freely.
- Adjust the brightness or zoom level of the displayed content for better visibility.

This program is especially useful for educators who teach using digital books or PDFs projected onto a whiteboard. Instead of displaying the entire screen, teachers can highlight specific questions or content by snipping and projecting only the relevant part.
